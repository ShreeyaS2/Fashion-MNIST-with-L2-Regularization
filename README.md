# Fashion-MNIST Neural Network from Scratch (with L2 Regularization)

This project implements a fully connected neural network from scratch using only NumPy to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
No deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras) are used.

### The focus of this project is to:

- Understand forward and backward propagation at a low level
- Implement ReLU + Softmax + Cross-Entropy
- Experiment with L2 regularization and observe its effect on training
